Intel RealSense D435i Installation Guide for Jetson Orin AGX
============================================================

commands to use
make the script a excecutable
chmod +x install_d435i.sh

run it
./install_d435i.sh


Overview
--------
This package automates the installation of Intel RealSense drivers on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX running JetPack 6. 
It addresses the specific issue where the default Jetson kernel does not support the D435i IMU (Gyro/Accelerometer), causing "Motion Module" errors.

Contents of install_d435i.sh
----------------------------
The script performs the following automated steps:

1. KERNEL PATCHING (The "Fix"):
   - Clones the 'jetson-orin-librealsense' repository from JetsonHacks.
   - Extracts pre-compiled kernel modules specific to JetPack 6.
   - Installs these modules to enable HID/IMU support for the camera.

2. SDK INSTALLATION:
   - Registers Intel's secure public keys.
   - Adds the official Intel Debian repository to the system sources.
   - Installs 'librealsense2-utils' (Viewer/Tools) and 'librealsense2-dev' (C++/Python headers).

3. FINALIZATION:
   - Reloads udev rules to ensure the camera is detected with correct permissions via USB.

How to Use
----------
1. Open a terminal in the folder containing the script.
2. Make the script executable:
   chmod +x install_d435i.sh
3. Run the script:
   ./install_d435i.sh
4. Enter your sudo password when prompted.
5. When the script finishes, REBOOT your Jetson.

Verification
------------
After rebooting:
1. Connect the D435i camera to a USB 3.0 port.
2. Open a terminal and run:
   realsense-viewer
3. Toggle the "Motion Module" to ON. If the 3D cube moves when you tilt the camera, the installation was successful.
